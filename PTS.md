Why must I withdraw my PTS to a PTS wallet?

There is risk in storing your PTS on an exchange so its best practice not to do this.

In addition you wont get any BitShares (or shares in any other DACs) if you keep your PTS on the exchange. This is because when Invictus launches a DAC it will reward PTS holders with shares in the new DAC by rewarding the addresses which contain the PTS. If your PTS is stored on an exchange, the exchange’s PTS address will receive your BitShares.



PTS wallet management

How do I safely store PTS on a PTS wallet/client?

You can download the client for MAC or Windows or download and compile the code from here www.protoshares.com.

Note: I prefer to use MAC as there are less security issues.

Run the client and allow it to sync with the network.

Before you send any PTS to your wallet, you first need to encrypt the wallet. You can do this by clicking on the ‘settings’ tab and then ‘encrypt wallet’. 

It will ask you to type in a password (encryption key) twice. Use a password of at least 32 characters. It is best to not use any real words or patterns but a random string of letters (in lower case and capitals), numbers and characters such as $@^&*

Important: Do not save your password on your computer or type it into any program. Your password should be written down on good old fashioned paper. You write the password down twice on two different pieces of paper for storage in different locations. DO NOT LOOSE THIS PASSWORD OR YOU WILL LOSE YOUR PTS.



How do I backup my PTS wallet?

You can create a backup of your wallet by clicking on the ‘file’ tab then ‘backup wallet’. 

Just to be 100% sure also backup your wallet by making a copy of your wallet.dat file found in %AppData%/protoshares on Windows and ~/.protoshares on Linux.

The .protoshares folder is a hidden folder. 

To make it visible on mac check out this link: http://www.mikesel.info/show-hidden-files-mac-os-x-10-7-lion/

To make it visible on windows check out this link: http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/show-hidden-files-in-windows-7/

Store your backups in multiple off-line, off-computer locations. You can store it on flash drives and cds which can be stored at different locations (such as home and work).

Once you have backed up your wallet. You can delete the wallet.dat file found in the .protoshares folder. This will remove your wallet from your computer making your wallet less vulnerable to hackers. Hackers may be able to get into your hard drive but they will find it allot harder to get into your desk at work.

Note: Store your wallet.dat file and pass-phrase separately. So that if someone gets hold of one they still wont be able to get your PTS without the other.

Importantly: you should refresh this backup of your wallet.dat file at least every 99 transactions.  You need to do this because the wallet starts out with a pool of 100 key pairs that are used for transactions that require new key pairs.  Once you have used up the 100 key pairs your wallet can create new key pairs when syncing with the network. This new wallet with refreshed key pairs should then be saved. IF YOU DO NOT DO THIS YOU CAN LOSE PTS!



How do I restore my PTS wallet from a backup? 

If you need to gain access to your PTS do the following:
*   Install the client 
*   copy your wallet.dat back into the .protoshares folder (replacing the wallet.dat file that will be there)
*   Sync with the network and you should see your transactions and balance.

Note: Only keep your wallet.dat file in your .protoshares folder when you want to have access to your PTS. Otherwise keep it offline for safety.



How will I claim BitShares (BTS) using PTS?

Invictus is developing a user friendly software where you would simply download the BitShares client and then point it at your PTS wallet.dat file to collect your BTS.



After collecting my BTS what do I do with my PTS?

I would advise you keep them! PTS has value because it functions as a social contract. May more DACs may come and honour the social contract, thus you are earning a stake in a new industry of DACs.






BitShares PTS ("ProtoShares")?
=======================================


Owning BitShares PTS is a way to acquire shares in future DACs and speculate on their value today!

What is BitShares PTS?
BitShares PTS is a class of crypto-currency that let you capture a position in future DACs before they are ever implemented. The speculative value of PTS is a subjective mix of three market 
perception pillars. These pillars are the market’s assessment of:

* The speculative value of a future DAC share.
* The probability that the DAC can and will be successfully fielded.
* Confidence that the PTS will map to an equitable share in the implementation.

... summed across all DACs that announce there intention to honor PTS holders with shares when launched.

Developers use BitShares PTS to capture early adopter interest in their new idea. 

Investors use PTS to get in on the ground floor of an entire new industry.  Instead of enduring the hassles and costs of mining every new DAC into existence, they focus on acquiring PTS once and for all, and thereby claim a stake in every new DAC that honors BitShares PTS.

Developers and Investors start on a level playing field for obtaining BitShares PTS. They are being slowly mined and easily accessible from public exchanges as one of the top crypto-currencies on the market.

What about that Third Pillar?

The third Public Perception Pillar is confidence that owning a DAC’s PTS will translate into 
actual ownership of an equitable share in the objective DAC. It is up to the DAC developer to convince 
the market that this will happen using whatever social consensus the market will accept. The PTS Social Consensus is simply:

> At our DAC’s pre-published launch time, a DAC’s genesis block shall be initialized
> to precisely match the current unspent outputs of the corresponding BitShares PTS blockchain.

> For every BitShares PTS proto-share you hold at that launch time, you now have a corresponding 
> share in the DAC accessible via the same public address to which you hold a private key. 

That’s it. Simple. Easy to understand. Real hard to renege.

You can read about the latest, more general form here:  http://invictus-innovations.com/social-consensus/

What do you mean “real hard to renege” on your social consensus? 

Who would want to abandon the entire universe of informed early adopters by reneging on their rights as 
founding shareholders? In this business, the network effect of market share is everything. Besides, if 
someone deploys an open-source DAC without honoring the social contract to its PTS holders,
someone else will simply fork the open source code, and honor that contract. Bingo, they’re in business! 
The network effect of informed early adopters will do the rest and the reneging developer’s implementation 
will go into the dustbin of history.

BitShares PTS were designed to be mined into existence according to the curves below.  This has been considerably accelerated in practice by the overwhelming amount of interest from the mining community.
