1. **What is Invictus?**
2. **So… Invictus Creates DACs?**
3. **How can I get involved?**
4. **I have mad coding skills, who can I talk to about a job?**


DAC
---
1. **What is a DAC?** DAC stands for Distributed Autonomous Company. It is a software entity that, like a traditional company, aims to earn money for its shareholders. Unlike a traditional company, it is autonomous: once created, it requires no board of directors or CEO to accomplish its goals.
2. **Why Decentralized?**
3. **Why Autonomous?** Autonomy is necessary to ensure that despite having no board of directors, the DAC functions properly on its own. Bitcoin is autonomous in this way: the Bitcoin Foundation could disappear tomorrow, but Bitcoin software would go on validating transactions as if nothing had changed.
4. **Why Company?** This is the key factor that distinguishes DACs from earlier cryptographic enterprises like Bitcoin. Bitcoin is Decentralized and Autonomous, but since it does not generate income for its shareholders, it is not a DAC. 
5. **How is a DAC different from a traditional company?**
6. **What can be done with a DAC?** This is the 100-billion-dollar question! The whole project of Invictus is to find the answer. At the moment, it is theorized that music distribution, publishing, gambling, DNS, voting, and personal identity verification can all be accomplished with DACs.


BitShares PTS (Formerly known as ProtoShares)
-----------------------------------------------
1. **What is BitShares PTS?** BitShares PTS is a simple crypto-equity (similar to Bitcoin) that was created by Invictus to allow people to "buy in" to the concept of DACs. The idea is that when a DAC is launched, at least 10% of the DAC's total shares are given proportionally to holders of PTS. Daniel Larimer once described buying PTS as "buying shares in the concept of DACs."
2. **Why isn’t it called ProtoShares anymore?**
3. **What is a snapshot?** Before a new DAC is launched, the DAC developer will announce a "snapshot date" at some point prior to launch. The snapshot date is like a date of record for a stock dividend; anybody who owns PTS on the snapshot date is given a proportional stake in the new DAC.
5. **Do I lose my PTS after a snapshot?** No, PTS are the gift that keeps on giving! Just like you don't lose your stock when a company pays a dividend, you won't lose your PTS when you get new shares in a DAC.
6. **Why should I get PTS rather than AGS?** The main advantage of PTS is that it is liquid. Since it's just a simple crypto-equity, you can sell your PTS on an exchange (like Cryptsy, Poloniex, BTC38, or many others) whenever you wish.
7. **How can I get PTS?** You can purchase PTS on any Bitcoin exchange. For a comprehensive guide, go to LINK TO PTS BUYING GUIDE
8. **What is the Social Consensus?** The Social Consensus is a concept pioneered by Invictus that states that developers of new DACs honor PTS (and AGS); that 10% of the total shares in any new DAC be apportioned to holders of PTS.
9. **Why would some other DAC developer honor PTS (and AGS)?** By giving part of their new DAC to holders of PTS (and AGS), the developer immediately puts their DAC in the hands of a large dynamic motivated community that believes in the concepts of DACs.



BitShares AGS (Formerly known as AngelShares)
-----------------------------------------------
1. **What is BitShares AGS?** BitShares AGS is similar to PTS in that AGS holders are granted stakes in new DACs proportionally to their holdings. The difference is that AGS holders have paid into a development fund rather than simply bought a crypto-equity. Thus, AGS is not liquid.
2. **Why isn’t it called AngelShares anymore?**
3. **What is a snapshot?** Before a new DAC is launched, the DAC developer will announce a "snapshot date" at some point prior to launch. The snapshot date is like a date of record for a stock dividend; anybody who owns AGS on the snapshot date is given a proportional stake in the new DAC.
4. **Do I lose my AGS after a snapshot?** No, AGS (like PTS) are the gift that keeps on giving! Just like you don't lose your stock when a company pays a dividend, you won't lose your AGS when you get new shares in a DAC.
5. **Why should I get AGS rather than PTS?** The main advantage of AGS is that its market price reflects the fact that it is not liquid. That is, you typically get more "bang for your buck" with AGS than you do with PTS because you can't simply sell your AGS whenever you want.
6. **How can I get AGS?** If you have Bitcoin or PTS that you would like to donate, go to AGS LINK and follow the instructions.
7. **Should I donate Bitcoin or PTS to get my AGS?** On the AGS donation site, the Bitcoin column (on the left) and PTS column (on the right) have a field called "Donation Efficiency." If the Donation Efficiency of Bitcoin is %120, this means that at current donation rates and market prices, you're getting 20% more AGS by donating with Bitcoin than you would by donating PTS.


BitShares XT: The Decentralized Bank and Exchange
-----------------------------------------------
1. **What is BitShares XT?** BitShares XT is the first DAC being Developed by Invictus.
2. **What is the difference between BitShares X and XT?** 
2. **What happened on February 28, 2014?** This was the snapshot date for BitShares XT. PTS and AGS holders on this date will be given a stake in BitShares XT.
3. **When will BitShares XT launch?** At the earliest, BitShares XT will launch on the Ides of March.
4. **I owned PTS (or AGS) on February 28, 2014. How can I get my XTS?** BitShares XT has not launched yet. Don't worry, your PTS ownership was recorded and you'll be able to claim your XTS when BitShares XT is launched soon. Check back SOMEWHERE for updates.
5. **I did not own PTS (or AGS) on February 28. How can I get XTS?** Since the snapshot date is passed, you will have to wait until BitShares XT is launched and XTS is listed on an exchange, where you will be able to buy it like any other crypto-equity.
6. **How does BitShares XT work?**
7. **How does BitShares XT interface with the traditional money system?**



Future DAC Plans
-----------------------------------------------
1. **What future DACs is Invictus planning?**
2. **How can I get a stake in future DACs?** You can buy PTS or donate to AGS!
3. **I have a great idea for a DAC. Who do I talk to?**












What are AngelShares? 
=====================

AngelShares is a crowd funding operation that works to support the development of DACs. It functions like a mining pool where every day shares are mined and divided among contributors proportional to how much they contributed. Rather than hash-power based proof-of-work like Bitcoin based Digital Currencies, AGS uses money as a reusable PoW making it an efficient resource-light community operation that does not divert hash power used to secure Protoshares.

Like ProtoShares, they represent a way to gain a stake in the new crypto-equity industry. ProtoShares acknowledge a contribution to the launch of the new industry, representing a proof of work done in generating public interest. AngelShares acknowledge an equally important financial contribution to the industry infrastructure.


How to Get Angel Shares

It couldn’t be easier.  Beginning New Year’s Day 2014,
there will be 10,000 new AGS up for grabs in a new patron competition every day for 200 days. 
5000 of them will be available to PTS holders. 
5000 of them will be available to Bitcoin holders.  
That's ultimately 2,000,000 total shares, just like PTS.

Those who donate bitcoins to this address will proportionally split 5000 AGS:

Those who donate PTS to this address will proportionally split 5000 AGS:

PaNGELmZgzRQCKeEKM6ifgTqNkC4ceiAWw

Every day the shares are divided among those who donated that day.

Be vigilant! Watch for slow days and anyone can snag some great bargains.

Don't send donations from anywhere but your own wallet!

DAC developers will initialize their genesis blocks to honor the key where your donation came from!

"What happens to all the donations?"

100% of the proceeds go to growing the crypto-equity industry. Zero percent  will be retained as profits Invictus.

Funds will be used to encourage new developers with salaries, grants, contracts, and bounties to build everything from small components to entire new DACs.  They will be used provide a free high-quality Developer's Toolkit giving DAC developers a huge head start.  They will be used for advertisements, conferences, promotions and give-aways to stimulate interest in the new industry and to provide opportunities for everyone to contribute.  They will be used for legal advocacy for the ecosystem in many jurisdictions.  Anything that we believe will grow the value of PTS and all DACs that honor the contributions of PTS and AGS holders.

It is beyond our control to prevent a copycat from forking our open source code in a way that fails to honor our promises.  It is up to the market to reject this, or not.  If you do not like our proposed allocation, do not trust the market to reject copycats, or do not trust us to deliver then please take your money, fund competition, and build your own DACs that fit your preferred allocation strategy.  


Merry Christmas Keyhotee Founders!!
The first 10,000 AGS are set-aside proportionally for Keyhotee Founders.  Invictus Innovations shareholders are not eligible.  Donations to Keyhotee after Dec 24, 2013 at Midnight GMT don't count.


Jan 1st, 2014 shall include all transactions sent to the Angel addresses in 2013.

Invictus Innovations will not send money from the Angel Address back to the Angel Address as this would completely undermine the entire value proposition.
If we pay bounties, sell PTS or BTC to pay salaries for services then we have no way to prevent those individuals from deciding to reinvest back into the fund.  From a block chain perspective it will be very hard to audit this behavior without us freezing the funds.   We will be as transparent as possible about where we spend the funds and this should make it clear that we are not recirculating funds.  In this business trust is everything so we will protect our integrity in this area because without it we are sunk. 

I have created a google docs XLS sheet to track all expenses paid from the Angel fund.  Our goal is to make everything as transparent as possible.
