I just dumped a bunch of content from the forum on here, now time to organize



What is a DAC?
==============



BitShares PTS ("ProtoShares")?
=======================================


Owning BitShares PTS is a way to acquire shares in future DACs and speculate on their value today!

What is BitShares PTS?
BitShares PTS is a class of crypto-currency that let you capture a position in future DACs before they are ever implemented. The speculative value of PTS is a subjective mix of three market 
perception pillars. These pillars are the market’s assessment of:

* The speculative value of a future DAC share.
* The probability that the DAC can and will be successfully fielded.
* Confidence that the PTS will map to an equitable share in the implementation.

... summed across all DACs that announce there intention to honor PTS holders with shares when launched.

Developers use BitShares PTS to capture early adopter interest in their new idea. 

Investors use PTS to get in on the ground floor of an entire new industry.  Instead of enduring the hassles and costs of mining every new DAC into existence, they focus on acquiring PTS once and for all, and thereby claim a stake in every new DAC that honors BitShares PTS.

Developers and Investors start on a level playing field for obtaining BitShares PTS. They are being slowly mined and easily accessible from public exchanges as one of the top crypto-currencies on the market.

What about that Third Pillar?

The third Public Perception Pillar is confidence that owning a DAC’s PTS will translate into 
actual ownership of an equitable share in the objective DAC. It is up to the DAC developer to convince 
the market that this will happen using whatever social consensus the market will accept. The PTS Social Consensus is simply:

> At our DAC’s pre-published launch time, a DAC’s genesis block shall be initialized
> to precisely match the current unspent outputs of the corresponding BitShares PTS blockchain.

> For every BitShares PTS proto-share you hold at that launch time, you now have a corresponding 
> share in the DAC accessible via the same public address to which you hold a private key. 

That’s it. Simple. Easy to understand. Real hard to renege.

You can read about the latest, more general form here:  http://invictus-innovations.com/social-consensus/

What do you mean “real hard to renege” on your social consensus? 

Who would want to abandon the entire universe of informed early adopters by reneging on their rights as 
founding shareholders? In this business, the network effect of market share is everything. Besides, if 
someone deploys an open-source DAC without honoring the social contract to its PTS holders,
someone else will simply fork the open source code, and honor that contract. Bingo, they’re in business! 
The network effect of informed early adopters will do the rest and the reneging developer’s implementation 
will go into the dustbin of history.

BitShares PTS were designed to be mined into existence according to the curves below.  This has been considerably accelerated in practice by the overwhelming amount of interest from the mining community.

What are AngelShares? 
=====================

AngelShares is a crowd funding operation that works to support the development of DACs. It functions like a mining pool where every day shares are mined and divided among contributors proportional to how much they contributed. Rather than hash-power based proof-of-work like Bitcoin based Digital Currencies, AGS uses money as a reusable PoW making it an efficient resource-light community operation that does not divert hash power used to secure Protoshares.

Like ProtoShares, they represent a way to gain a stake in the new crypto-equity industry. ProtoShares acknowledge a contribution to the launch of the new industry, representing a proof of work done in generating public interest. AngelShares acknowledge an equally important financial contribution to the industry infrastructure.


How to Get Angel Shares

It couldn’t be easier.  Beginning New Year’s Day 2014,
there will be 10,000 new AGS up for grabs in a new patron competition every day for 200 days. 
5000 of them will be available to PTS holders. 
5000 of them will be available to Bitcoin holders.  
That's ultimately 2,000,000 total shares, just like PTS.

Those who donate bitcoins to this address will proportionally split 5000 AGS:

Those who donate PTS to this address will proportionally split 5000 AGS:

Every day the shares are divided among those who donated that day.

Be vigilant! Watch for slow days and anyone can snag some great bargains.

Don't send donations from anywhere but your own wallet!

DAC developers will initialize their genesis blocks to honor the key where your donation came from!

"What happens to all the donations?"

100% of the proceeds go to growing the crypto-equity industry. Zero percent  will be retained as profits Invictus.

Funds will be used to encourage new developers with salaries, grants, contracts, and bounties to build everything from small components to entire new DACs.  They will be used provide a free high-quality Developer's Toolkit giving DAC developers a huge head start.  They will be used for advertisements, conferences, promotions and give-aways to stimulate interest in the new industry and to provide opportunities for everyone to contribute.  They will be used for legal advocacy for the ecosystem in many jurisdictions.  Anything that we believe will grow the value of PTS and all DACs that honor the contributions of PTS and AGS holders.

It is beyond our control to prevent a copycat from forking our open source code in a way that fails to honor our promises.  It is up to the market to reject this, or not.  If you do not like our proposed allocation, do not trust the market to reject copycats, or do not trust us to deliver then please take your money, fund competition, and build your own DACs that fit your preferred allocation strategy.  


Merry Christmas Keyhotee Founders!!
The first 10,000 AGS are set-aside proportionally for Keyhotee Founders.  Invictus Innovations shareholders are not eligible.  Donations to Keyhotee after Dec 24, 2013 at Midnight GMT don't count.


Jan 1st, 2014 shall include all transactions sent to the Angel addresses in 2013.

Invictus Innovations will not send money from the Angel Address back to the Angel Address as this would completely undermine the entire value proposition.
If we pay bounties, sell PTS or BTC to pay salaries for services then we have no way to prevent those individuals from deciding to reinvest back into the fund.  From a block chain perspective it will be very hard to audit this behavior without us freezing the funds.   We will be as transparent as possible about where we spend the funds and this should make it clear that we are not recirculating funds.  In this business trust is everything so we will protect our integrity in this area because without it we are sunk. 

I have created a google docs XLS sheet to track all expenses paid from the Angel fund.  Our goal is to make everything as transparent as possible.
