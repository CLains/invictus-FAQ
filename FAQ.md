DAC
---
1. **What is a DAC?** DAC stands for Distributed Autonomous Company. It is a software entity that, like a traditional company, aims to earn money for its shareholders. Unlike a traditional company, it is autonomous: once created, it requires no board of directors or CEO to accomplish its goals.
2. **Why Decentralized?**
3. **Why Autonomous?** Autonomy is necessary to ensure that despite having no board of directors, the DAC functions properly on its own. Bitcoin is autonomous in this way: the Bitcoin Foundation could disappear tomorrow, but Bitcoin software would go on validating transactions as if nothing had changed.
4. **Why Company?** This is the key factor that distinguishes DACs from earlier cryptographic enterprises like Bitcoin. Bitcoin is Decentralized and Autonomous, but since it does not generate income for its shareholders, it is not a DAC. 
5. **How is a DAC different from a traditional company?**
6. **What can be done with a DAC?** This is the 100-billion-dollar question! The whole project of Invictus is to find the answer. At the moment, it is theorized that music distribution, publishing, gambling, DNS, voting, and personal identity verification can all be accomplished with DACs.


BitShares PTS (Formerly known as ProtoShares)
-----------------------------------------------
1. **What is BitShares PTS?** BitShares PTS is a simple crypto-equity (similar to Bitcoin) that was created by Invictus to allow people to "buy in" to the concept of DACs. The idea is that when a DAC is launched, at least 10% of the DAC's total shares are given proportionally to holders of PTS. Daniel Larimer once described buying PTS as "buying shares in the concept of DACs."
2. **Why isn’t it called ProtoShares anymore?**
3. **What is a snapshot?** Before a new DAC is launched, the DAC developer will announce a "snapshot date" at some point prior to launch. The snapshot date is like a date of record for a stock dividend; anybody who owns PTS on the snapshot date is given a proportional stake in the new DAC.
5. **Do I lose my PTS after a snapshot?** No, PTS are the gift that keeps on giving! Just like you don't lose your stock when a company pays a dividend, you won't lose your PTS when you get new shares in a DAC.
6. **Why should I get PTS rather than AGS?** The main advantage of PTS is that it is liquid. Since it's just a simple crypto-equity, you can sell your PTS on an exchange (like Cryptsy, Poloniex, BTC38, or many others) whenever you wish.
7. **How can I get PTS?** You can purchase PTS on any Bitcoin exchange. For a comprehensive guide, go to LINK TO PTS BUYING GUIDE
8. **What is the Social Consensus?** The Social Consensus is a concept pioneered by Invictus that states that developers of new DACs honor PTS (and AGS); that 10% of the total shares in any new DAC be apportioned to holders of PTS.
9. **Why would some other DAC developer honor PTS (and AGS)?** By giving part of their new DAC to holders of PTS (and AGS), the developer immediately puts their DAC in the hands of a large dynamic motivated community that believes in the concepts of DACs.



BitShares AGS (Formerly known as AngelShares)
-----------------------------------------------
1. **What is BitShares AGS?** BitShares AGS is similar to PTS in that AGS holders are granted stakes in new DACs proportionally to their holdings. The difference is that AGS holders have paid into a development fund rather than simply bought a crypto-equity. Thus, AGS is not liquid.
2. **Why isn’t it called AngelShares anymore?**
3. **What is a snapshot?** Before a new DAC is launched, the DAC developer will announce a "snapshot date" at some point prior to launch. The snapshot date is like a date of record for a stock dividend; anybody who owns AGS on the snapshot date is given a proportional stake in the new DAC.
4. **Do I lose my AGS after a snapshot?** No, AGS (like PTS) are the gift that keeps on giving! Just like you don't lose your stock when a company pays a dividend, you won't lose your AGS when you get new shares in a DAC.
5. **Why should I get AGS rather than PTS?** The main advantage of AGS is that its market price reflects the fact that it is not liquid. That is, you typically get more "bang for your buck" with AGS than you do with PTS because you can't simply sell your AGS whenever you want.
6. **How can I get AGS?** If you have Bitcoin or PTS that you would like to donate, go to AGS LINK and follow the instructions.
7. **Should I donate Bitcoin or PTS to get my AGS?** On the AGS donation site, the Bitcoin column (on the left) and PTS column (on the right) have a field called "Donation Efficiency." If the Donation Efficiency of Bitcoin is %120, this means that at current donation rates and market prices, you're getting 20% more AGS by donating with Bitcoin than you would by donating PTS.


BitShares XT: The Decentralized Bank and Exchange
-----------------------------------------------
1. **What is BitShares XT?** BitShares XT is the first DAC being Developed by Invictus.
2. **What is the difference between BitShares X and XT?**  BitShares X is a family of DACs based on the decentralized exchange concept. Each one will have its own blockchain and different variations on the core idea. BitShares XT is the first BitShares X DAC. Future BitShares X DACs will use snapshots of XT for their initial allocations, just like BitShares XT used a PTS/AGS snapshot for its initial allocation
2. **What happened on February 28, 2014?** This was the snapshot date for BitShares XT. PTS and AGS holders on this date will be given a stake in BitShares XT.
3. **When will BitShares XT launch?** At the earliest, BitShares XT will launch on the Ides of March.
4. **I owned PTS (or AGS) on February 28, 2014. How can I get my XTS?** BitShares XT has not launched yet. Don't worry, your PTS ownership was recorded and you'll be able to claim your XTS when BitShares XT is launched soon. Check back TODO SOMEWHERE for updates.
5. **I did not own PTS (or AGS) on February 28. How can I get XTS?** Since the snapshot date is passed, you will have to wait until BitShares XT is launched and XTS is listed on an exchange, where you will be able to buy it like any other crypto-equity.
6. **How does BitShares XT work?**
7. **How does BitShares XT interface with the traditional money system?**
